I love the smiling lady portrait! Using mainly simple circles to create a wonderful portrait really shows how simple can make something more beautiful. I love the addition of the bubbles in the background and the interactive blush/hair changes to show that she is really just smiling through life. 

In your code, you do a great job at organizing your variables at the top. One thing however, in your draw() function, every shape is drawn manually (not using a seperate function). It is good practice to declare a drawObject (whatever that object may be) and reuse functions for clode clarity and legibility. But other than that you organize your other functions quite well and good use of conditional to see if the mouse is on the cheeks for the blush or not.

Overall, great job on the art-jam. When I first opened the work, I began smiling similarly to the piece which means it does a great job conveying what you wanted!

Wow! Opening this I had no idea what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised. The artwork really goes super saiyan! I love what happens when you hover over the eyes and then clicking at the same time. It really feels like the entire screen is shaking and that the portrait is "powering up".

Great job organizing your code as well! You created a function to draw each piece of the portrait and organized all your variables properly. One thing I noticed is you use a lot of hard coded numbers in your drawX() functions, which should be changed to facilitate future modifications and it keeps the code organized.

Ultimately, I really like this piece and it definitely suprised me a lot when clicking and hovering around. I also love the hand/circle that is following the mouse.

Starting off, the abstract work of this piece is amazing. I really love how the piece vizually looks and how the eye follows the cursor around whilst the colors/background changes. It really seems like such a nice portrait yet it is created with simple shapes which makes it even cooler. The eye closing and opening is also a great touch and it feels like a museum artwork where the eyes always somehow follow you

I think the simplicity of the piece is the best part and even in your code it reflects that. There isn't a lot and it makes it so every shape and line has significance. One thing that could be organized a little better are the hard coded numbers, but other than that your functions, variables and conditionals are all done very well and organized correctly.

Great job! I like this one a lot!
