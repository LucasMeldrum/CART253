# Ideas for Mod-Jam

1. Frog has a long tongue and must dodge scissors (changing the size of the tongue to dodge scissors? where is the frog located? What happens when frog's tongue gets cut)
2. You control the fly (How? Simple or difficult? Like flying a plane? How does the Frog attack?)
3. Frog is constantly blinking and making the screen black (How often? He could be falling asleep. Difficult game idea)
4. Medival Frog (Theme the entire game to as medival as possible? Could he use a sword instead of his tongue? Black Plague?)
5. Frog is hopping to lily pads (To catch flies? If he misses he drowns)
6. Frog is dying and needs to eat to live (He is a hungry guy must eat as many flies as possible)
7. There are too many flies! (King of flies reference idk? The entire screen could be covered in flies making it creepy and people with insect phobia scared boo!)
8. Frog is a zombie eating the flies' brains! (Eat the fly but then must disect to get its brain? Multy level game)
9. Frog is dead (funeral with flies carrying the coffin? How did he die? Why?)
10. Fly is dead (Same idea as before but frog is sad? He doesn't get to eat now. I dont know)
11. Frog doesn't like flies but you are forcing him to eat (He is trying to not eat but you must mash to keep his tongue forward. Why doesn't he like to eat flies?)
12. Frog has music and is vibing (Just a chill guy)
13. Frog is blind and is going off sound (Entire game could be black and must go off of sound purely. How would this look to be engaging?)
14. Frog isn't a frog but is a spider (Creating a web to catch the flies? Crawling around the screen)
15. Score does wacky things every point (Each point does a new flashy thing)
16. Fly trying to eat the frog (Roles are reversed. How does the fly try to eat the frog?)
17. Frog is the grim reaper (WHAT? The bringer of death doing his job? Killing the fly with a scythe)
18. Frog and Fly are best friends (trying to give a kiss? Idk they could just hang out and watch a movie)
19. Frog is dying of old age (Fly's are nurses giving him his meds, tells the story of a frog losing his mind...)
20. Frog and Fly is just a simulation (maybe we all are in one? The eating of the fly could be a scary realization of the fake world and simulation that the frog is living in. In reality, nothing is left)
